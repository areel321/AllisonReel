              <h3>Education</h3>
              <p>Recently, I graduated with my Bachelors Degreen from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. At Smith, I was a Computer Science major with a Landscape Studies minor. 
                I've taken coursework in programming with Python, C, and Java, algorithms and data structures, networking and network security, landscape design, 
                urban studies, mapping and spatial analysis. For additional skill-building, I've taken Technical Interview Prep, Intro Web Development, and Intermediate Web Development with CodePath. 
               </p>

              <h3>Experience</h3>
              <p>I have experience in the fields of software engineering, networking research, GIS research, and customer service.
                I completed a SWE Internship at M&T Bank where I developed and modernized an Angular web application. During semesters, I worked at the Smith College Music Department as an Office Assistant and Event Manager.
                I also participated in research for both the Cho Lab and Greenway Lab at Smith. These experiences all provide me with great time management, 
                affinity of working with others, and team building skills. 
              </p>

              <h3>Activities</h3>
              <p>Outside of my studies, I served as a Student Representative on Smith's Campus Planning Comittee, 
                a Cirriculum Team Member of the Jandon Center's Robotics Initiative, 
                as well as House Historian and House Social Events Coordinator for Parsons House Council. 
              I also participated in Badminton Club and have previously taken violin lessons with Anthony Berner at Smith.

              <h3>Hobbies</h3>
              <p>Some of my favorite things to do in my free time are work on personal projects, 
                go see movies with friends, crochet, and take very long walks around the neighborhood 
                and nearby bodies of water. I love going to the beach in the summer and walking in snow in the winter.
